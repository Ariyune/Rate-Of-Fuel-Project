The development methodology that our group is going to use is the incremental development.
We decided to use this methodology because the requirements of this project are clearly explained and understood.
One of the characteristics of this methodology is that a project or software is split into different stages,
which is what we are going to do in this class: first the front end, second the back end, and finally the database.
In addition, since we are in a shorter semester, we are appling incremental development because it is used when there is a tight deadline or deadlines.
